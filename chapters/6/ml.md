```{admonition} Three Paths to Learn Machine Learning
**Path 1 (Bad path)**
1. Learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning models only
2. Learn how to use TensorFlow | Keras | Scikit-learn
3. Start using them on the data.

**Approximate Learning Time:** 6 months to 1 year.

**Path 2 (Good path)**
1. Learn Linear Algebra, Calculus (differential and integral) and Statistics
2. Learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning
3. Learn how to use TensorFlow | Keras | Scikit-learn
4. Start using them on the data.

**Approximate Learning Time:** 2 years.

**Path 3 (Worst path)**
1. Learn pure and abstract math (e.g. Topology, Abstract Algebra, Differential Geometry, Algebraic Geometry)
2. Learn applied maths (e.g. Real analysis, Measure theory, Functional analysis, Topological Degree theory, Partial and Ordinary differential equations, Numerical analysis, Complex Analysis, Optimization)
3. Learn advanced computer science (e.g. Graph theory and combinatorics, Topological data analysis, Advanced algorithms)
4. Learn classical Statistics and probability theory
5. Learn Bayesian Statistics and Bayesian inference theory
6. Learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies
7. Learn how to use TensorFlow | Keras | Scikit-learn
8. Start using them on the data.

**Approximate Learning Time:** 10 years.
